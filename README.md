### What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?

On Monday, February 26, 2018 I attended Design Reality's Changing Lives with Immersive Technology in Health Care Meetup. The meetup took place in New Relic's Portland offices, and catered to a wide audience of developers, artists, employers, and health care professionals.

### Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?

This meetup was organized by Joshua Young and Design Reality. They've been hosting these virtual reality meetups for 3 years, and have developed quite a large community of enthusiasts in Portland, Oregon. Speakers included specialists from Providence Health and HP, both of whom shared stories of their companies push towards the progressive use of virtual reality in the medical industry.

### What was the format of the event?

The event began with an hour of networking, accompanied by free thai food and VR demos by Portland Immersive Media Group, ChickTech, and Panogs. The bulk of the event was the presentations, which were streamed live in 360 video on several social media outlets. The event ended with another half an hour of networking time, and there was an after-party/ continued networking at Portland City Grill.

### What was the topic or main focus of the event?

The focus of this event was on the implementation of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality in the medical industry. The first speakers with Providence Health focused on a case-study in which those suffering from post-op pain from gastrointestinal surgeries were given access to VR headsets in their hospital rooms. The second speaker focused on HP's dedication to the medical industry, and how they are pushing to promote the use of augmented and mixed reality tech in the operating theater, as well as virtual reality for pain mediation and distraction post surgery and during chemotherapy.  

### What made you want to attend this particular event?

I've been a fan of the Design Reality meetups since I started listening to Voices of VR, a podcast created by Kent Bye, who headed the first VR meetup in Portland back in 2015. I've always been interested in the altruistic use of technology, especially through the affordances offered to us with VR/AR and MR. I also was able to get in as a volunteer for the Portland Immersive Media Group. For the first part of the networking event I helped run a demo of PIMG's Ontology Museum, A VR experience built in Unity that allowed people to explore a fantastical museum made by my friends and colleagues Matt Henderson and Stephanie Mendoza.

### What was the highlight of the event?

The speakers with Providence Health gave an honest representation on what testing VR in the medical industry really means. The data they received from their study was mediocre at best, but helped to establish a more codified way of dealing with testing VR in a medical scenario. What they did find through their study was that despite a patient's feelings towards VR, there was a noted 30% decrease in the use of opiod-medication post surgery for patients who had access to VR headsets in their hospital room. Despite the obstacles they faced in getting this study through all the red tape of the medical industry, they were able to walk away with a better concept of the implementation of VR for pain therapy.

### What did you learn from this experience?

I learned that working with Health Service isn't just an opportunity that is afforded to those who are willing to go through medical school, but rather it is something that anyone can set their mind to. I learned about the bureaucracy of the medical industry and how tech experiments have to keep medical staff and policy in mind when planning a health service focus study, everything must be able to be sanitized! I also learned that surgeons and doctors are successfully using augmented reality and mixed reality to study complicated vascular systems in depth before operation.

### If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events do send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)

I enjoy the Design Reality meetups and have no critique besides the desire for them to occur more often.

### Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?

I would recomment this even to anyone interested in working with VR/AR or MR technology. The event is set on connecting employers in the tech industry with those who need to be employed. Artists, developers, and VR enthusiasts are all welcome.

### Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.

I'm looking forward to volunteering at these events more often. Helping run a demo really gave me the appearance as if I knew what I was doing. There seem to be alot of great minds at these meetups, and the conversations are all worthwhile.
